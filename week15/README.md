# SOLID
- **S**ingle responsibility 
    - "*A class should have one and only one  reason to change.*" 
- **O**pen/closed principle"
    - *Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification*"
- **L**iskov substitution principle
    - "*Let P(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then P(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.*"
    - or simply  "*Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.*:" 
    
- **I**nterface segregation principle
    - "*Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.*"
- **D**ependency inversion principle - *depend upon abstractions, not concretions*
    - A "*High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces).*"
    - B "*Abstractions should not depend on details. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions.*"
